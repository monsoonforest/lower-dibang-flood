#### Climate change and deforestation is spreading the Dibang river unfolding a humanitarian and ecological crisis. Part 1.

### The disappearance of two villages
Between August and September 2015 the plains and foothills of eastern Arunachal Pradesh received as excess of 100 mm of rainfall everyday for two weeks. By 11th September the villages of Anpum and Loklung in Paglam circle of Lower Dibang Valley district, Arunachal Pradesh, were entirely washed away by an expanding Dibang river.

Residents escaped via motor-boats in the nick of time. Since 2010 they had held on to the last strings of hope that their village river, once crossable by foot, would expand slowly given it had been captured by the Dibang several years earlier. However, they were not prepared for the river to triple its width (80m to 250m) in two weeks after 350mm of excess rainfall. Munsu Perme recollects being able to salvage only the most basic household essentials, while caring for her sister and her new born. The most vulnerable members of the community were the first to cross the expanding Dibang river by paite or motorboat. Munsu’s husband Dibang Perme recollects taking off in the morning darkness to find the paite, bushwhacking through the dense understory below Semul trees (Silk cotton, Bombax ceiba). He walked under a deluge of rain as the river rapidly eroded the banks on either side of the village. Across the river, the vulnerable who escaped camped under tarpaulins and makeshift bamboo huts erected in their farmlands. Most men including Dibang Perme, had to wait out the storm under tarpaulins on the same side near their flooded villages as the paite was low on diesel and the river was too dangerous to cross. They survived on salt, rice and small game as it took several days until help arrived from neighbouring villages. This was finally the end of a thriving community complete with Primary Health Centre and higher secondary school. The only sign that a society once lived here are the crumbling pillars of a bridge on a large sand bar in the centre of the river (fig. 2 and 3).

### A history of changing channels
The flooding of Anpum and Loklung in 2015 is regarded as the worst disaster since 1950 along the last 50 km of the Dibang’s western bank. Never had the present generation seen as much destruction in such short a time. However, after piecing together eye-witness accounts of floods, historical observations and examining archival satellite imagery as far back as the 1980’s, it is evident that the changing course of the Dibang river is part of a complicated feedback system between the ecology, hydrology, geology and meteorology of this region going back millions of years (lower_dibang_valley-landsat-1988-2020-annotated-ii.mp4).
This complicated feedback system was touched upon by Frank Kingdon-Ward, a botanist exploring Arunachal Pradesh, during his observations of the damage to Upper Assam after the M 8.6 earthquake on August 15th 1950 (now located near the border of Lohit and Lower Dibang Valley district, Arunachal Pradesh). After traversing several smaller valleys devastated by the earthquake along the Lohit valley he travelled towards the Dibang observing that the valley had suffered more than the Lohit. The Dibang river was blocked and had changed its course, draining further east (eventually destroying Nizamghat after 18 months) “threatening to wipe out Sadiya.” Which it finally did, purana Sadiya is now a large grassland, home to hundreds of cattle and tens of vultures.

Up until 1998 the bulk of the Dibang river’s volume drained via channels closer to the eastern bank. However, extreme rainfall events in May-June 1998 following a very severe cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal, rapidly opened new channels, expanding old and abandoned channels close to the western bank. Images captured by Landsat 5 indicate increased sediment deposition from expanding landslides where the river debouches onto the plain. Excess sediment loads along with debris and vegetation are known to block channels and raise river beds, triggering the formation of new channels in the flood basin – a process termed as avulsion or detachment of a channel from the drainage network. Such avulsion is typical in anastomosing rivers that are composed of several channels spread across a vast flood-basin to accommodate the immense volume of water and sediments draining through them during the wet season. Since 1998 the western bank has witnessed a violently eroding and expanding river, while the eastern bank has been calmer and productive as vegetation continues to recover. N. Pertin recollects abandoning his home in Lasum village 20km north of Anpum near the Dotung river (then the western most channel of the Dibang). The old road across the river, crossable by foot during the dry season was obliterated, along with their grain stores, the forest colony and inspection bungalow. Sixty percent of their crops that year were lost along with vast areas of cultivable land and palm groves leaving behind thick deposits of sediments. The people of Lasum resettled at Bizari, then a forest colony for timber operations. Life continued here precariously held in balance by a productive wet season, that provided rice, yet laid waste good arable land. Only to be raided in the dry season by elephants seeking nutritious food as their favoured trees were logged in the surrounding wilderness.


### Deforestation and extreme rainfall accelerate river bank erosion
When asked if they applied and received compensation for crop loss, N. Pertin replies, “apply apply no reply”, wryly summarizing the indifference of all government administrations to their complex problems. Now in his 70s he explains that Bizari was developed as a forest colony in 1965 to support logging operations. Yet unusually the people of Bizari have not been officially recognized as land-owners even after decades of cultivating small parcels of  land, as it is “within” Dambuk Reserve Forest and they are considered encroachers. This perspective is at odds with the history of the area – only 30km away is Bomjir (Bomjur in older literature) a village established sometime after the Padam Adi tribe migrated from Damro in Upper Siang district (established between c. 1200 – c. 1300; Pertin 2015). The Idu Mishmi tribe have lived in this region for even longer than the Adi tribe. Thus they have certainly had a longer presence in this area than the notifiers of Dambuk Reserve Forest. As it stands now the Arunachal Pradesh Forest Department is severely understaffed and short of funds, neither able to control illegal logging nor compensate farmers for crop loss.

Satellite images show a large swathe of seemingly excellent forest cover in the region, and global forest loss datasets estimate loss has occurred only when river avulsion, flooding or shifting cultivation occurs. This is far from the ground truth, Semul is the dominant species in the ecosystem as it’s soft wood is unsuitable for furniture. It grows relatively fast (60 cm/year) and its deciduous nature (sheds all its leaves between January-March) allows for a dense understory jungle to develop. This shows up as “green” all year round even on very high-resolution (50cm) satellite sensors. Semul is commonly observed in satellite images and their height indicates logging has been ongoing for 50 years or more. However, large crowned tree species (>40m diameter) such as hard wood Dipterocarpus species and Terminalia myriocarpa (hollock) have been logged into rarity (fig. 5). The consequences are evident in the flood basin of the Sesseri river that meets the Dibang at Bizari. By 2014 a well developed channel could be observed making its way into these regenerating forests after eroding and breaching its left bank. This new channel cuts off Bizari from the rest of the administrative circle every year during the wet season and has impeded the construction of a bridge ever since. New channels have started to breach the bank creeping further into the forest. Such change in river geomorphology has been observed across the world in ecosystems undergoing deforestation (references in Sheth et al 2020). This is the state of affairs across the flood-basins of the Dibang, Siang and Lohit. Logging continues unchecked and the rivers erode hundreds of meters of bank every year, taking away forests, grasslands and cropland. A historical case in point - decades of deforestation along the southern fringe of Dibru Saikhowa National Park in Assam, lead to a new channel of the Lohit river to drain here, ultimately isolating it as a riverine island (dibru_saikhowa-landsat-1988-2020-annotated.mp4). Illegal logging continues along the northern bank of Dibru Saikhowa National Park with observable consequences. The residents of the villages along the 50km long western bank of the Dibang all agree that deforestation is partly to blame but how were they to know better when the state itself actively engaged in legal logging until 1998. Logging continues with a motto that - what is not  taken today will be taken by the river tomorrow (fig 7).

However, implicating only deforestation for the Dibang’s erosive nature will be inaccurate. Daily precipitation values from 1981-2020, archived by the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data [CHIRPS], show that the Dibang River Basin has received above normal rainfall (>2 standard deviation of the 40 year mean daily rain) on at least 10 days every year. Every year the number of days with >100mm rainfall is between 4-16. The year Anpum and Loklung were wiped out – 2015, there were 16 days with rain >100mm, five of those days were when the flood wiped them out and on one day >200 mm rain fell (an extreme event, fig. 8). While a more detailed analyses is warranted, the rainfall data when compared with satellite images unambiguously shows that above normal rainfall was associated with dramatic changes in the landscape such as sediment deposition several hundred meters from the bank, hundreds of meters of bank erosion etc. (refer technical document; fig. 9).

An incident sums up the ecological crises of this region – on the day I leave Anpum via a forest trail, I stop to examine a young tree with beautiful buttresses, hopefully wondering what it would become 50 years later. In a moment Dibang Perme takes a turn into my path and I ask him where all the large trees have gone, he looks at me earnestly and shakes his head. I ask why this tree wasn’t cut and he replies “yeh to reject maal hain” (this tree was rejected [by loggers]). These are the only trees remaining in this wilderness (fig. 10).
