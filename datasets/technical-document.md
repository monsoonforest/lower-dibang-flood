###        ​ Tropical cyclone 01B, May 1998
![tropical cyclone 01B]()
Before the cyclone’s landfall on 20th May 1998, Bangladesh relocated 650,000 people. The cyclone destroyed thousands of homes and taking lives of as many as 35 people there. After 10 days of widespread rainfall across Bangladesh, northeast India and Myanmar the remnants of 01B dumped an estimated amount greater than 200 mm on 30th May across a 16000 km2 area in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

In the month of June 1998, on 13 separate days, some places received greater than 280 mm of rainfall, indicating that extreme rainfall events occurred in patches across the geography of NE India and northern Myanmar. The Dibang river flood-basin received between 150 – 200 mm of excess rainfall in May, and 170 – 400 mm of excess rainfall in June.
An image taken by NASA’s earth observation satellite - Landsat 5, captured the Dibang during the flood in October 1998. The Dibang river had shifted its main flow 2 km west up to the limit of its floodplain.

Images from 1987 to 1997 show no evidence of shifts in the Dibang’s drainage pattern. Extreme rainfall from tropical cyclone 01B also expanded several landslides in Lower Dibang Valley and East Siang districts of Arunachal Pradesh. In particular two large landslides at Nizamghat, perhaps India’s largest ongoing landslides, increased five-fold in size between 1987 and 1998.

It is possible that these landslides first occurred during the aftermath of the 1950-1951 earthquakes in this region. In 1998 sediments from the landslides (and regions upstream) were deposited across the river’s floodplain altering its topography and washing away villages, burying flooded grasslands, forests, bamboo groves and agricultural land. Landsat 5’s image also shows sediment deposition and bank expansion of the tributaries of the Dibang such as the Anpum, Sesseri, Sesar, Deopani, Sine Korong and Tapat Korong (Korong is an Adi term for river; river names as per U.S. Army map compiled in 1954; sheet NH 46-16 series U502).
These two months of extreme rainfall that appear to be one of the triggers for the Dibang to abandon its old channels and drain into new ones, would prove to be catastrophic 18 years later for two villages in Lower Dibang Valley – Anpum and Loklung.
        ​ 
###        ​ A landscape of rivers, primed to flood
Geologically the region between the Siang and the Dibang is comprised of layers  of river sediments or alluvium, tens of meters thick, deposited since the middle Pleistocene (3.6 million years ago). These can be observed at several banks where layers of mud, sand and river rounded cobbles alternate with each other indicating the composition of the materials deposited by rivers. Hard rock is absent while clay, silt and sands are present thus allowing for effortless erosion by water.
Before the catastrophe of Anpum and Loklung, the drainage of some key rivers altered. However this was before the era of earth observing satellites and identifying these alterations is central to understanding the geographical changes of this region. The first alteration occurred sometime between 1950 and 1987 when the Sesseri river’s main channel shifted north and started draining into the Siang near Seram in the west. The changed course created a floodplain of sediments and flooded grasslands here. According to U.S. Army maps compiled in 1955 (sheet NH 46-4 series U502), the Sesseri initially drained further south into the “Ganga”, a channel of the Dibang, near Gadum. This was despite its NW-SE flow from the mountains. It is difficult to infer the cause of this geographical change, however, one can speculate based on the U.S. Army map compiled in 1954 (based on older maps prepared in 1927 and 1933) which states that, “drainage conditions may have changed considerably by the severe earthquakes and floods of 1950-1951”.
The second alteration occurred sometime after 1950 when the Sesseri river flood and deposited sediments over forests expanding its left bank further northeast and then drained part of its volume in the Dibang to the east. From a meandering river the Sesseri has now become a river with multiple channels enveloping its flood-basin spanning 20km at its widest, from Seram on the Siang to Bizari on the Dibang. This is the nature of anastomosing river systems, defined by Makaske (2001) as “[a]n anastomosing river is composed of two or more interconnected channels that enclose floodbasins.” The rivers that seem to originate as springs around Dambuk Reserve Forest are in fact part of the flood-basin of the anastomosing Sesseri. They are kept alive by forests and a high water table in the dry season later teeming with unique fish lineages as thunderstorms give in to the monsoon between March and November.
The effect of the Sesseri’s capture by the Siang has led to recent flooding and ruinous bank erosion along the left bank of the Siang. At Seram the Siang has eroded the bank and moved east by 1500 m taking away roads, agricultural land and forest groves.
![figure 5](https://github.com/monsoonforest/lower-dibang-flood/blob/main/datasets/images-for-technical-doc/fig-5-siang-2021.jpeg)
*figure 5: January 2021 PlanetScope image of the Siang's flood-basin at Pasighat, showing the main channel flowing along the left bank.*

It has taken over the area where a channel of the Sesseri and the Sibia once drained into the Siang. Further south near Namsing the Siang has moved east by 4000 m taking over the former floodplains of the Sesseri’s main channel that used to meander and drain into the Ganga. However, what it has taken it has replaced with fine sediments in Assam further south and beyond its ‘new’ confluence with the Dibang.
With the help of Landsat 5’s images we can infer that the region between Gadum and Seram is the past flood-basin of the Sesseri composed of mixed vegetation such as secondary forests, bamboo groves, flooded grasslands, wetlands, agricultural land and other woody cover. The erosion along  the Siang’s left bank is because it has abandoned its old channels, breaking  barriers in its flood-basin to form new channels. The Siang is also then by definition an anastomosing river system and the creation of new channels since the last century has been triggered by natural hazards such as lake outburst floods. Some of which are well known such as the great outburst floods of the Yigong Tso in 1900 and 2000. Recent lake outburst floods occurred in 2018 after extreme rainfall opened multiple earthquake triggered landslide dams on the Yarlung Tsangpo. Climate change triggered landslides from Sengdam Pu glacier on the Yarlung Tsangpo have also led to outburst floods in 2018. These recent floods are part of the reason the Siang is eroding its left bank.


###        ​ Where there is a way a river will flow
Between 1998 and 2013 the region of Anpum-Loklung received excess rain only in 2004, 2007 and 2012. While no obvious changes could be discerned in the geography from satellite images of 2004 and 2007, excess rain in July and September 2012 can be associated with changes in the Dibang’s deposition pattern. In 2012 CHIRPS daily rainfall data estimated an excess of 267-400 mm of rainfall for Dambuk and Paglam circles of Lower Dibang valley district. Images acquired by European Space Agency’s earth observing satellite – RapidEye-2 show the aftermath of the flood of 2012 through the deposition of sediments as far as 900 m inland from the Dibang’s right bank south of Bizari.
![figure 6](https://github.com/monsoonforest/lower-dibang-flood/blob/main/datasets/images-for-technical-doc/fig-6-anpum-2011.jpeg)
*figure 6: December 2011 RapidEye-3 image of Anpum-Loklung area before major floods.*

This is perhaps a significant alteration for several reasons. Firstly, it indicates the approximate height up to which the Dibang had risen during the flood, greater than 12 feet (based on the current height of the bank from the river in winter). Secondly, any barrier between the Anpum river (which starts as a spring in the forests and flood-basin of the Sesseri) and the Dibang river was completely destroyed and the Dibang could now deposit sediments in the Anpum’s channel. Thirdly, all smaller streams and rivers in this region between the Siang and Dibang show signs of sediment deposition indicating significant erosion upstream because of the excess rainfall. Images captured in 2010 by earth observing satellite GeoEye, show the Dibang river’s capture of  the Anpum river to be complete, however, sediment deposition and bank expansion did not occur until 2012.

*figure 7: December 2012 RapidEye-2 image of Anpum-Loklung area showing sediment deposition and expansion of Anpum river after floods.*

Lastly, the Dibang was starting to erode its bank at Bizari, a maximum of 89 m was eroded by one of the outer meanders of the Dibang’s channel. The right bank’s erosion is observable north and south of Bizari perhaps due to the effect of the Sesseri’s 2011 flood when it expanded its bank and cut a new channel through the selectively logged forests on its left bank.
In August of 2014 and 2015 rainfall occurred in excess by as much as 400 mm. In 2014 sediments do not appear to have changed the geomorphology of the Anpum river as much as a channel of the Dibang did, which flows to its east (referred to as the Dotung locally). The Dotung expanded its banks, pushing its meanders south depositing sediments over agricultural land, eroding the bank at Silling in Assam but giving land near Paglam. Between August 15th and September 19th 2015, Anpum received an estimated 996.7 mm of rainfall and based on images captured by Landsat-7 on August 11th and September 19th this was precisely the time period when the Dibang’s avulsion occurred. Half of Anpum and nearly all of Loklung washed away sometime during these 37 days.

*Figure 8d: October 2018 RapidEye-1 image of Anpum-Loklung area showing complete destruction of Anpum and Loklung. Loklung relocated further east. Anpum relocated in the north.*

In 2016 the destruction of Anpum was complete. Every single house was washed away including the many iterations made after every flood by the Missing tribe. From a small stream barely 100 m wide and easily crossed by foot it was now a 800 m wide raging channel. By May it had spread and swelled even more than October 2015 and by October 2016 it had eroded the right bank by another 200+ m. By 2021 this channel is nearly 1300 m at its widest now flowing through the old flood-basin of the Sesseri to meet the Siang well north of its previous confluence.

*Figure 9: January 2021 PlanetScope image of Anpum-Loklung area showing continuing expansion of Dibang's channel.*

Based on the observable geomorphology of the Dibang it is clear that it is an anastomosing river. According to studies on other anastomosing rivers this is the nature of such river systems, they abandon old channels, form new channels as the gradient in the new channel is more favorable or if the old channel is blocked by logs and debris. This process is termed as avulsion. In the past the Dibang has flooded its basin crisscrossing across forests depositing sediments, creating new wetlands and flooded grasslands. The burial of so much organic matter also happens to be lucrative for the oil industry. The Dibang has been spreading across its flood-basin for several centuries likely due to various triggers – excess rainfall events, climate change, earthquakes and outburst floods. However, what led to this sudden abandonment of its Dotung channel to flow into the Anpum river is a complex question to answer. Perhaps it is a combination of extreme rainfall, the effect of sediment deposition from India’s largest ongoing landslide, deforestation and the complete loss of old growth forests in the plains of Lower Dibang Valley, or maybe the hydrology of this region is complex due to the effect of other anastomosing rivers such as the Siang and Sesseri. The effect of earthquakes too cannot be ruled out as they can tilt the earth’s surface leading to the formation of new channels along favorable gradients.
